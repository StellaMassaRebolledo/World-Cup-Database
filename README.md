# World-Cup-Database
This project consisted of three exercises:
- Building the Database and its two tables: teams and games.
- Writing a bash script to insert the data from a csv file to the tables mentioned in the first step.
- Querying the tables according to a group of given instructions.

The games.csv and queries.sh, files were provided by FreeCodeCamp as part of its World Cup Database Project. This is the second project out of five that must be completed to earn their Relational Database Certification.
